I am not able to understand what to do when we have to show variable overriding behaviour. The problem is if the variable does not exist anywhere it will err out everything.
If the variable is overriden by another file, that variable 


I want to connect with dipesh sir on skype. Is it okay?

role2_task_vars: 'role2_task2_vars_applied'

hosts vars are still not considered important

They are simply different scopes that exist independently of each other, no sharing of variable.

inventory host_vars

play vars_prompt 
play vars_files

block vars

role (and include_role) params

include params

host facts / cached set_facts 4

playbook group_vars

inventory group_vars

inventory file or script host vars 2

playbook host_vars/* 3

done
include_role


not done
set_facts / registered vars




role defaults (defined in role/defaults/main.yml) 1 overrided playbook group_vars/all 3 which shall not be true according to the documentation.
