Understanding variable precedenceÔÉÅ
===============================
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable

Ansible does apply variable precedence, and you might have a use for it. Here is the order of precedence from least to greatest (the last listed variables override all other variables):

command line values (for example, -u my_user, these are not variables)

role defaults (defined in role/defaults/main.yml) 1

inventory file or script group vars 2

inventory group_vars/all 3

playbook group_vars/all 3

inventory group_vars/* 3

playbook group_vars/* 3

inventory file or script host vars 2

inventory host_vars/* 3

playbook host_vars/* 3

host facts / cached set_facts 4

play vars

play vars_prompt

play vars_files

role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)

block vars (only for tasks in block)

task vars (only for the task)

include_vars

set_facts / registered vars

role (and include_role) params

include params

extra vars (for example, -e "user=my_user")(always win precedence)

In general, Ansible gives precedence to variables that were defined more recently, more actively, and with more explicit scope.


Ansible Roles Directory Structure
===============================
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-directory-structure

# playbooks
site.yml
webservers.yml
fooservers.yml
roles/
    common/
        tasks/
        handlers/
        library/
        files/
        templates/
        vars/
        defaults/
        meta/
    webservers/
        tasks/
        defaults/
        meta/



Ansible Inventory Directory Structure
==============================
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#using-multiple-inventory-sources

Aggregating inventory sources with a directory

inventory/
  openstack.yml          # configure inventory plugin to get hosts from Openstack cloud
  dynamic-inventory.py   # add additional hosts with dynamic inventory script
  static-inventory       # add static hosts and groups
  group_vars/
    all.yml              # assign variables to all hosts

# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#organizing-host-and-group-variables

/etc/ansible/group_vars/raleigh # can optionally end in '.yml', '.yaml', or '.json'
/etc/ansible/group_vars/webservers
/etc/ansible/host_vars/foosball



Use of ansible_group_priority to set variable precedence.
----------------------------------------
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#how-variables-are-merged

a_group:
  vars:
    testvar: a
    ansible_group_priority: 10
b_group:
  vars:
    testvar: b

ansible_group_priority can only be set in the inventory source and not in group_vars/, as the variable is used in the loading of group_vars.


ansible.builtin.set_fact module
-----------------------------------------------
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9_ja/modules/set_fact_module.html#set-fact-set-host-facts-from-a-task

Set cacheable to yes to save variables across executions using a fact cache. Variables created with set_fact have different precedence depending on whether they are or are not cached.

facts not defined needs to wait for the user, so ansible decides to search for other places where tha variable may be defined. This causes facts_uncached to be initialised later and hence have higher precedence. While facts already cached have lower precedence as they can be immediately overriden.
